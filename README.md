# GenAi Use Cases

Welcome to the GenAi Use Cases repository! This project demonstrates the power of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAi) through various impactful use cases. By leveraging GenAi technology, users can explore innovative solutions to complex challenges across different industries.

## How to Use

To get started with the GenAi Use Cases, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GenAi-Use-Cases.git
   cd GenAi-Use-Cases
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Make sure to install all the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Once all packages are installed, run the following command to start the UI:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will launch the user interface (UI) provided by `app.py`, where you will find three different options of use cases:

   - **Chat with Document**: Interact with GenAi to engage in a conversation based on a document.
   - **Content Generation**: Explore GenAi's ability to generate creative and relevant content.
   - **Summarization**: Utilize GenAi to summarize lengthy text into concise and informative summaries.

4. **Prerequisites**:
   - Before using the application, ensure you have set up a knowledge base using Amazon Bedrock.
   - Point the application to an S3 bucket where your knowledge base is stored.
   - Create a trigger in the S3 bucket that initiates the `lambda_function.py` when a file is dropped into the bucket.

5. **Enjoy**:
   Explore the capabilities of GenAi through these use cases and witness the potential it holds for solving real-world problems.
